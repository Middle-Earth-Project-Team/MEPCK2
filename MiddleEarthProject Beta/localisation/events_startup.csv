#Armies
EVTNAMEmepstartup.3;Armies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmepstartup.3;Effectiveness of troops depends mainly on race. Ents and Trolls for example have huge combat bonuses. Noldor Elves have the best normal troops, closely followed by the Sindar and Dwarves. Silvan Elves and Númenoreans have good bonuses. Rohirrim and Uruk-hai have small bonuses. Hobbits and Orcs are weaker, and have slight maluses. All other races have standard vanilla effectiveness. \n\nAs a result, a huge army of Orcs can be defeated by a considerably smaller army of Elves. When playing with a weaker race make sure you account for the strength of your enemies troops. \n\nFor full info check character Race descriptions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Purging and Colonising
EVTNAMEmepstartup.4;Purging and Colonising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmepstartup.4;In order to spread your culture within this mod you must use the purge and colonise mechanics. \n\nMuch of the world is wilderness and in order to expand into this wilderness you must declare war with the Settle casus belli. Once you have occupied and annexed the land you must send your steward on a colonisation mission to that province, and then activate the Colonise Province decision. Be advised, colonisation is not cheap, and not entirely risk free. \n\nPurging is necessary when a foreign and hostile culture resides in your lands. You must send your marshal on a purge mission to that province, and activate the Purge decision. This is also not risk free, after all, they may not want to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
